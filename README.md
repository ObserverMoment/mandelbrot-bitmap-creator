# Mandelbrot Bitmap Creator

This is an Xcode file built project so the easiest way to get it running will be to download the whole repo to your machine. Then open in xCode and hit run!

## TODOS
- Fractal displays in a window rather than being exported as a bit map
- Live zoom to a new point on user click (with recalculation of the fractal)
- Option to 'print' a current screen position to a bitmap file
